# first project including an online api "themealdb" <br>used help of AI in getting recipe card, as the url has the premium access, <br> I had to use the free version in this, so a timer icon is added in place of id, as the api donot contain the timing duration <br>currently learning to build own api, will modify the project as soon as own api is built
